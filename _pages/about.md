Welcome!

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Abstract Security, and a CS MSc student at USC.
Previously, I received my BS in Physics from UCR.
My main interests are in probabilistic modeling, causal inference and more recently applied NLP/LLMs.

Before joining Abstract, I worked on [Causal RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15489) at USC,
developing safe transfer learning methods for agents.
I also had the opportunity to contribute to interdisciplinary data science research
at the [ISI](https://isi.edu), including
[Social Network Analysis](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article-abstract/10/2/cnac007/6561923)
and [Geology](https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fessoar.10508800.1).
Even before that, I helped [analyze X-ray tomography data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-TMeE2Pv4qcCTmtendvrjPiJjFDz7Oh/view?usp=sharing) from the [Advanced Light Source](https://als.lbl.gov)
for NASA Entry Systems Parachutes.
My research journey started off as a Physics student in [Barsukov lab](https://barsukov.ucr.edu), working on micromagnetic magnetic simulations.

In my free time, I enjoy challenging for Local Legends/KOMs on
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/59785368),
attending music festivals and traveling!
